The rule was characterised by a dual system of government, in which the British Crown exercised political control over a number of Indian princely states and through them, over the whole of India. In theory, the princes were responsible to the British Crown for the administration of their states and were expected to provide a link between the British Crown and the Indian people. In practice, the princes were often more interested in their own power and wealth than in fulfilling their responsibilities to the British Crown. The British Raj was ended on 15 August 1947 following the independence of India and the partition of British India into India and Pakistan. The British Raj was a result of the British Empire's need to control India in order to protect its interests in the region and to expand the British Empire. The British Raj was not the first attempt by the British to rule over India. The British had ruled India for over two centuries before the Raj, and there were numerous attempts by the British to establish a single, unified rule over India. The British Raj was also different from the rule of the Mughals, who had been the dominant Muslim dynasty in India before the British arrived. The British Raj was based on the principle of British sovereignty over India, and the British Raj authorities exercised full administrative control over all of India. The British Raj authorities exercised this control through a system of indirect rule, which means that the British Raj authorities exercised their authority through local Indian rulers. The British Raj authorities also used force to control the Indian people. The British Raj authorities controlled the Indian army, and the British Raj authorities used the Indian army to control the Indian people. The British Raj authorities also used the Indian police to control the Indian people. The British Raj authorities used the Indian postal service to control the Indian people.

Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in London during the Second World War, where he helped to develop the first computer, the ACE. After the war, Turing worked at the University of Manchester, and then at the University of Cambridge, where he developed the first theoretical model of a computer. Turing was also the first person to be prosecuted for homosexual offences in the UK. He was convicted of gross indecency in 1952 and was given a chemical castration sentence, which he accepted. He died in 1954, aged 41, after taking cyanide. Turing is widely considered to be the father of computer science, and he is also credited with pioneering the theory of artificial intelligence."

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 expanded the definition of adulterated and misbranded to include any drug that was not in compliance with standards set by the Food and Drug Administration. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 was passed in response to the public's growing concern over the abuse of drugs. The act created the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to regulate the manufacture, distribution, and possession of controlled substances. The act also created the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to research the effects of drugs and develop treatments. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 is the most comprehensive drug law in the world. It has been amended several times, most recently in 2009."

The act also recognized the Catholic Church as the official religion of the British Empire in North America.

In 1776, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, which called for the colonies to break free from British rule. The British responded by sending troops to quash the rebellion. In 1783, the British Parliament passed the New York Constitution, which granted the new state a bicameral legislature and a governor appointed by the king.

The first time the Sabbath was mentioned in the Bible, it was the first day of the week."

A Democrat, he won a record four presidential elections and became a central figure in world events during the mid-20th century. He directed the United States government during most of the Great Depression and World War II, and is often considered to have been one of the greatest U.S. presidents. Roosevelt was born in 1882 to an old New York family from the Hudson Valley. He attended the elite boarding school Phillips Exeter Academy and then Harvard College, where he became a member of the prestigious Porcellian Club. After graduating from college in 1904, Roosevelt worked as a journalist for the New York Evening Post. He entered politics in 1910, serving in the New York State Senate and as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson. In 1920, Roosevelt was elected governor of New York, and two years later he was elected president of the United States, defeating Republican incumbent Herbert Hoover. Roosevelt took office during the Great Depression, and during his four terms as president, he enacted many programs to combat the economic crisis. These programs were known as the New Deal, which helped to revive the economy and make America the world's leading economic power. In 1940, Roosevelt was elected to a fourth term, becoming the only U.S. president to serve more than two terms. In 1945, Roosevelt died of a cerebral hemorrhage two days after victory in the presidential election, making him the only U.S. president to die in office.

The final transition introduces the \"Sacrificial Dance\". This is written as a more disciplined ritual than the extravagant dance that ended Part I, though it contains some wild moments, with the large percussion section of the orchestra given over to the howling of wolves.

The Republican Party was founded in 1854 by anti-slavery activists, who opposed the expansion of slavery into the new territories acquired in the Mexican\u2013American War. The party's platform advocated for economic modernization, free labor, and western expansion. The party became the dominant political party in the United States in the 1860s, 1870s, and 1880s, when it won four of the five presidential elections. The Republican Party's platform became the dominant force in American politics, and by 1912, it had captured control of all the state governments. In 1912, the Republican Party nominated Theodore Roosevelt for president, but he was defeated by the Democrat Woodrow Wilson. After the war, the Republican Party's leader, William Howard Taft, became the first president to be elected to two consecutive terms. The Democratic Party The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States, the other being the Republican Party. The Democratic Party was founded in 1828 by Andrew Jackson, who became the first U.S. president to be elected by the popular vote. The Democratic Party's platform emphasizes social and economic justice, along with the welfare of the poor and working class. The party has also promoted the civil rights and civil liberties of Americans. Since the 1990s, the Democratic Party has been in control of the U.S. federal government."

The Democrats were founded in 1868 by Andrew Johnson, the former U.S. Senator from Tennessee and 18th President of the United States. The two parties competed in the first national election in 1856, with the Republican Party winning a majority of the electoral votes but not a majority of the seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Republican Party's success in gaining control of the House in 1874 and 1876 was due to its platform of economic modernization and civil reform, as well as its support of the gold standard. The Democrats lost ground in the 1890s, but they made a comeback in the 1920s and 1930s, largely as a result of the New Deal. The New Deal Coalition of 1932\u20131964 united many of the most important elements of the Democratic Party\u2014farmers, labor unions, urban intellectuals, and African Americans\u2014behind the president. After Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1936 re-election, the coalition dominated American politics for the next four decades. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Democratic Party was the party of civil rights, while the Republican Party was the party of white supremacy. After the 1960s, the Democratic Party shifted to the left and became the party of liberal social policies. The Republican Party has since shifted to the right and is now the party of fiscal conservatism and free market capitalism."

Sheridan wanted a fort to protect the Overland Mail route and the new settlers in the area. The fort was abandoned in 1883, and the site was used for a number of years as a military reservation. In 1885, the Wichita and Arkansas Valley Railroad was built through the area, and the town of Wichita, Kansas, was founded near the site of the fort. The town was named after Wichita Creek, which ran through the town. In 1887, the town was moved to its present location. The fort was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961."

After the fall of the Mughal Empire in the early 18th century, the region came under British rule. The British decided to name the region after the Bengali word for \"eastern\", because they believed that the region would be east of the Assam region.

As printing technology improved and the number of typefaces grew, it became difficult to distinguish one typeface from another. To make matters worse, different printers would use different marks to represent the same letter. To solve this problem, printers began to use a single mark to represent all letters of a typeface. This mark was known as a typeface mark or a type mark character. The first typeface mark was introduced in 1824 by the American printer John Baskerville. It was a small cross that he used to represent the letter \"e\". In 1892, the American typeface designer Frederic Goudy created the first typeface with a typeface mark that represented the letter \"a\". The typeface mark for \"a\" was a circle that was drawn above the letter \"a\" in the typeface's lowercase characters. In 1922, the typeface designer Herbert Matter created the typeface mark for \"e\" that was a small cross that was drawn above the letter \"e\" in the typeface's lowercase characters. The typeface mark for \"e\" was also used to represent the letter \"i\". In 1928, the typeface designer Robert Slimbach created the typeface mark for \"o\" that was a small circle that was drawn above the letter \"o\" in the typeface's lowercase characters. The typeface mark for \"o\" was also used to represent the letter \"u\". In 1936, the typeface designer Max Miedinger created the typeface mark for \"t\" that was a small cross that was drawn above the letter \"t\" in the typeface's lowercase characters. The typeface mark for \"t\" was also used to represent the letter \"y\". In 1954, the typeface designer Robert Slimbach created the typeface mark for \"w\" that was a small circle that was drawn above the letter \"w\" in the typeface's lowercase characters. The typeface mark for \"w\" was also used to represent the letter \"v\". In 1972, the typeface designer Robert Slimbach created the typeface mark for \"y\" that was a small cross that was drawn above the letter \"y\" in the typeface's lowercase characters.

However, after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, the empire lost control of Anatolia, and while the Komnenos dynasty restored a degree of stability in the 12th century with help from the First Crusade, the empire was captured and partitioned by the Crusaders themselves in the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Even after Byzantine rule was restored in 1261, the empire was now a shadow of its former self, and after the end of the Crusades, the empire had little to set against the rise of the Ottoman Empire during the late medieval period, and was eventually conquered with the Fallof the southern kingdom of judah which he destroyed them both.

The British Army under the command of General Charles Cornwallis was attempting to march to Virginia and join up with the forces of the Duke of Cornwallis, who was in the process of besieging the American capital of Washington, D.C. The American Army under the command of George Washington, with the help of French troops, was able to repel the British and force them to retreat back to Yorktown, where they surrendered after a siege that lasted five months. The battle was one of the largest in American history, and resulted in the surrender of British forces and the beginning of the end for the British Empire.\""

The first few digits are 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230781640628620899862803482534211706791828185360287998628034825342117067918281853602879986280348253421170679182818536028799862803482534211706791828185360287998628034825342117067918281853602879986280.\n\nWho sings came in like a wrecking ball on the album Bangerz by Miley Cyrus?"

What is the difference between a dean's list and a honor roll? A dean's list is an academic award, or notation, used to recognize the level of highest scholarship demonstrated by students in a college or university. This system is most often used in North America, though institutions in Europe, Asia, and Australia may also employ similar measures. It is often synonymous with honor roll and honor list, but should not be confused with honours degrees. Generally, students enrolled in college or university would need to satisfy a series of specific requirements before receiving the Dean's List. These requirements may differ across institutions, but in most cases will require students to achieve a certain grade point average (GPA) or have completed a certain number of course hours. A student who receives the Dean's List is typically considered to have achieved a high level of academic achievement."

The British Army, under the command of General John Burgoyne, was attempting to march from Fort Ticonderoga to New York City, while the American Continental Army, under the command of General George Washington, was attempting to stop them. The battle, which took place in present-day New York, resulted in a British victory. The battle began with a British advance on the American positions, but was turned back with heavy casualties. The Americans then launched a counterattack, which drove the British back to their original positions. The battle ended with the British retreating from the field. The battle is significant because it was the first time that the Americans had successfully defended their positions against a British attack."

The ball fell to the ground, and Cubs catcher Michael Barrett threw to first baseman Todd Hundley, who then threw to second baseman Rich Aurilia, who then threw to first baseman Ron Santo, who then threw to second baseman Mike Piazza, who then threw to catcher Mike Matheny for the out. The Marlins went on to score two runs in the eighth inning, and the Cubs lost the game, 4\u20133. Bartman was subsequently vilified by the Cubs and their fans, and he was booed by the home crowd at Wrigley Field on subsequent occasions. In the days and weeks following the game, various conspiracy theories circulated on the Internet, including allegations that the ball had been tampered with, that the Cubs had been tipped off to the Marlins' strategy, and that Bartman had deliberately interfered with the play. After an investigation by the Chicago Police Department, Bartman was not charged with any crime. In October 2010, Bartman filed a $5 million lawsuit against the Cubs, alleging that the team had defamed him by calling him a \"thief\" and a \"liar\". The suit was settled in December 2011 for an undisclosed amount.\n\nWho is the cubs fan who caught the foul ball Steve Bartman incident?"

It is the largest and most famous church in Florence. The cathedral is the largest in the world by volume and has the world's largest dome. The cathedral has been the site of many significant events, including the funeral of Lorenzo de' Medici, the marriage of Catherine de' Medici to Henry II of France, and the canonization of John Paul II. The cathedral is also the final resting place of Michelangelo's David. The cathedral was started in 1296 on the orders of the Florentine banker and politician, Lorenzo de' Medici, as a church for the guilds of the wool merchants. The original plan was for the church to be dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, but Lorenzo's wife, Bianca Cappello, convinced him to dedicate it to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. The construction was carried out between 1296 and 1348, during the rule of the Florentine Republic, by the architect Arnolfo di Cambio. The original cathedral had only three naves, the central one of which was later converted into a transept. The crossing was finished in 1345, and the dome was not finished until 1436. The cathedral was consecrated on May 14, 1348. The original cathedral was destroyed by a fire in 1527, and was rebuilt by Giorgio Vasari. The dome was finished by Giotto in 1337. The original campanile was replaced by a new one in 1610. The original bronze doors of the Baptistry were replaced by new bronze doors by Lorenzo Ghiberti in 1420. The original doors of the Duomo were also replaced in the same year. The original marble pulpit was replaced by a new one by Donatello in 1433.

DNA is organized into chromosomes, which are divided during mitosis. DNA is also organized into genes, which are the instructions for making proteins. DNA is copied into the chromosomes of the daughter cells. The process of mitosis is divided into two stages: prophase and metaphase. In prophase, the chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles of the cell and the nuclear envelope breaks down. In metaphase, the chromosomes line up along the equator of the cell and the cell divides in two. Credit formitosis is given to the French scientist, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Lamarck is best known for his theory of evolution, which states that acquired characteristics can be passed on to offspring. In 1809, he published a paper in which he described the mitotic division of cells as a process of inheritance. In 1810, he published a paper in which he described the role of chromosomes in this process. In 1816, he published a paper in which he described the role of DNA in this process.

He was also the god of law and order, and was responsible for assigning mortals to their appropriate tasks. Zeus was portrayed as a powerful and sometimes cruel figure. He was also known for his sexual liaisons with mortals, which led to many children being born with deformities. After overthrowing his father Cronus, Zeus ruled over the gods for many years. He was eventually forced to relinquish his authority to his son, Apollo, and retired to the island of Crete. In later myths, Zeus married Hera, the goddess of marriage and women, and fathered Ares, Hebe, and Aphrodite. After being defeated by the hero Heracles, Zeus fled to the underworld. Zeus was also known for his many affairs, including those with the nymphs Melia, Mnemosyne, and Thetis. He was also involved with the goddess Aphrodite, who bore him Eros. After being defeated by the hero Perseus, Zeus was imprisoned in the underworld. He was eventually freed by the hero Heracles and restored to his former power.

Wonder was born in Saginaw, Michigan, in 1950, to a mother who was a church organist and a father who worked in a factory. When Wonder was six, his mother died of a heart attack, and his father was so devastated that he put Wonder in a Catholic orphanage. Wonder later said of his childhood, \"I never knew my mother, but I loved her. I loved her so much it was like she was my mother.\" After being adopted by a family in Detroit, Wonder became interested in music at an early age and began playing the piano at the age of eight. When he was 12, he formed a vocal group with some of his classmates, and they performed at local churches. In the early 1960s, Wonder played with the Detroit group the Soul Searchers. In 1965, he moved to New York City and formed the R&B group the Wonderlove Unlimited Orchestra, which released one album. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Wonder worked with producers Phil Spector and Jerry Wexler, and recorded such hits as \"I Just Called to Say I Love You\", \"Superstition\", and \"I Believe in You\". Wonder also released an album of his own material, \"Songs in the Key of Life\", in 1976. Wonder's popularity continued to grow in the 1980s and 1990s, and he won several Grammy Awards. In the late 2000s, Wonder began performing with a band consisting of a string section, woodwinds, and brass. In 2013, Wonder was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.
